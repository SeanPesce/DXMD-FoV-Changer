Enhanced FoV Options for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
Made by SeanP


This mod allows you to change the Field of View in DXMD (including higher or lower values than the game normally allows) at the press of a button. It also allows you to change the rendered FoV of your hands separately, so weapon animations won't look strange on higher FoV settings.

Installation: Install the x64 Visual C++ 2015 Runtime (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145), and then merge the \Deus Ex Mankind Divided\ folder with the one in your Steam library directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\)

NOTE: If you already had Special K installed before installing this, make sure you dxgi.ini has the following in it:
[Import.DXMD_FOV]
Architecture=x64
Filename=DXMD_FOV.dll
When=Lazy
Role=ThirdParty

Default keybinds:
Increase FoV: +
Decrease FoV: -
Increase Hands FoV: period
Decrease Hands FoV: comma
Restore Game default FoV: Delete

You can change the keybinds and default FoVs by going to \Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail\ and editing DXMD_FOV.ini

This mod is built on top of Kaldaien's Special K dll, which also adds support for other stuff (such as texture dumping). To edit Special K settings, go to the \Deus Ex Mankind Divided\ folder and edit dxgi.ini. You can find more info about Special K here: https://github.com/Kaldaien/SpecialK/releases/tag/sk_043
