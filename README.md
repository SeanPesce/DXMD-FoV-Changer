This mod allows you to [change the Field of View](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=qWjd7HO216A) in [DXMD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/337000) and [Deus Ex: Breach](http://store.steampowered.com/app/555450) (including higher or lower values than the games normally support) at the press of a button. It also allows you to [change the rendered FoV of your hands separately](https://gfycat.com/EqualDeliriousGyrfalcon), so weapon animations won't look strange on higher FoV settings.

## Installation:  
Copy dxgi.dll and DXMD_FOV.ini into the `\retail\` directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail`).  


## Default keybinds  
Increase FoV: +  
Decrease FoV: -  
Increase Hands FoV: period  
Decrease Hands FoV: comma  
Restore Player Preferred FoV: Backspace  
Restore Game default FoV: Delete  
  
You can change the keybinds and default FoVs by going to `\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail\` and editing `DXMD_FOV.ini`.
