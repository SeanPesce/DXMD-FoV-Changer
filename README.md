A mod to [change the Field of View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWjd7HO216A) in [DXMD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/337000) and [Deus Ex: Breach](http://store.steampowered.com/app/555450) at the press of a button. Most notably, this mod supports higher/lower values than the games normally allow, and lets the user [change the rendered FoV of the first-person hands separately](https://gfycat.com/EqualDeliriousGyrfalcon), so weapon animations won't look strange on higher FoV settings.  

## Installation:  
Copy **dxgi.dll** and **DXMD_FOV.ini** into the `\retail\` directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail`).  


## Default keybinds  
Increase FoV: +  
Decrease FoV: -  
Increase Hands FoV: period  
Decrease Hands FoV: comma  
Restore Player Preferred FoV: Backspace  
Restore Game default FoV: Delete  
  
You can change the keybinds and default FoVs by going to `\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail\` and editing `DXMD_FOV.ini`.
