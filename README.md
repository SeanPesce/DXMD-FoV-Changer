This mod allows you to change the Field of View in DXMD (including higher or lower values than the game normally allows) at the press of a button. It also allows you to change the rendered FoV of your hands separately, so weapon animations won't look strange on higher FoV settings.

## Installation:  
Copy dxgi.dll and DXMD_FOV.ini into the `\retail\` directory (usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail`)


## Default keybinds  
Increase FoV: +  
Decrease FoV: -  
Increase Hands FoV: period  
Decrease Hands FoV: comma  
Restore Player Preferred FoV: Backspace  
Restore Game default FoV: Delete  
  
You can change the keybinds and default FoVs by going to \Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail\ and editing DXMD_FOV.ini
