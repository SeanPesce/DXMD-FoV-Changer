Enhanced FoV Options for Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
Author: Sean Pesce


This mod allows you to change the Field of View in DXMD (including higher or lower values than the game normally allows) at the press of a button. It also allows you to change the rendered FoV of your hands separately, so weapon animations won't look strange on higher FoV settings.

Installation: Merge the \Deus Ex Mankind Divided\ folder with the one in your Steam library directory (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Deus Ex Mankind Divided\)


Default keybinds:
Increase FoV: +
Decrease FoV: -
Increase Hands FoV: period
Decrease Hands FoV: comma
Restore Player Preferred FoV: Backspace
Restore Game default FoV: Delete

You can change the keybinds and default FoVs by going to \Deus Ex Mankind Divided\retail\ and editing DXMD_FOV.ini
